Stream() && Parallel Stream()
-----------------------------
-> In stream it will process or request the element in sequentially
-> In Parallel Stream will process or request the element in parallely so that performace also will increase.
-> when we really care about the performance then we can go for using the parrallel stream.
-> so in parallel stream it uses the multiple cores of the processor.
-> parallel stream is taking the less time when compared to the stream.
